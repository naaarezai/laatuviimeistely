# Image Placeholder Instructions

Since the image generation service is currently unavailable, the website uses Unsplash placeholder images for now. You can replace these with your own professional photos later.

## Image Locations

All images should be placed in the `images/` directory:

1. **hero-bg.jpg** (1920x1080) - Hero section background
   - Suggested: Construction site or renovation project overview
   
2. **pientalo.jpg** (800x600) - Small house construction
   - Suggested: New house being built or finished small house
   
3. **kylpyhuone.jpg** (800x600) - Bathroom/kitchen renovation
   - Suggested: Modern bathroom or kitchen renovation
   
4. **perusremontti.jpg** (800x600) - General renovation
   - Suggested: Interior renovation work in progress
   
5. **maalaus.jpg** (800x600) - Painting work
   - Suggested: Painter working or freshly painted interior
   
6. **terassi.jpg** (800x600) - Terrace and outdoor structures
   - Suggested: Beautiful wooden terrace or outdoor structure
   
7. **sisustus.jpg** (800x600) - Interior design work
   - Suggested: Finished interior space with quality finishes

## Temporary Solution

The HTML has been updated to use Unsplash placeholder images with construction/renovation themes. These will display properly while you prepare your own professional photos.

## How to Replace

1. Take or collect your professional project photos
2. Optimize them for web (compress to reasonable file sizes)
3. Rename them according to the list above
4. Place them in the `images/` directory
5. The website will automatically use your images
